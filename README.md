# Project-Valentine
 Here’s a suitable README.md for your "Valentine Yes or No Prank" website project:  Valentine Yes or No Prank ❤️ This is a fun and lighthearted prank website where users are presented with a "Yes" or "No" question about Valentine’s Day. However, the twist is that "No" cannot be selected, and users can only type or select "Yes"!  

## Features ✨
- **Interactive prank**: Users are tricked into thinking they have a choice, but they can only select "Yes."
- **Simple and elegant design**: Built using only HTML and CSS.

## How It Works 🛠️
